🌿 Plant Identifier App — Powered by AI
A smart and user-friendly mobile/web application that helps users identify plants in real-time using advanced AI image recognition tools. Just take a picture, and the app tells you the plant’s name, description, and care instructions.

📌 Features
📷 AI-Based Image Recognition: Instantly identify plants using AI models trained on thousands of plant species.

📖 Plant Info: Get detailed descriptions, growth habits, care tips, and more.

🧠 Learning Mode: Suggestions for similar plants to expand user knowledge.

🗺️ Geo-Tagging (Optional): Know the native location of the plant species.

📚 Offline History: Save past identifications locally.

☁️ Cloud Integration: Sync data and photos across devices.

🛠️ Built With
Component	Stack / Tool
Frontend	React.js / React Native
Backend	Node.js + Express / Firebase
Image Processing	TensorFlow.js / Teachable Machine / Custom Model
Database	MongoDB / Firebase Realtime DB

🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites
Node.js (v16+)

Yarn or npm

Firebase or similar cloud backend

Teachable Machine or pre-trained model files

Installation
bash
npm run dev
For React Native:

bash
Copy
Edit
npx expo start
🧠 How It Works
User uploads or takes a photo of a plant.

The image is sent to a trained AI model (e.g., TensorFlow.js).

The model predicts the plant type and returns metadata.

The app displays results including common name, species, and tips.

📷 Model Training (Optional)
You can train your own model using:

Google Teachable Machine

TensorFlow or PyTorch with a plant dataset like PlantCLEF
